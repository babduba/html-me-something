					If you want a book about the benefits of using scrum without going into the details of how to scrum, this is the book for you.
					The author takes you through a journey of failed waterfall methodoligies and how scrum can overcome those shortfalls of the same.
					I really enjoyed listening to this book especially as our team transitioned to using scrum and I needed a solid introduction of scrum.

					The Phoenix Project was very relatable to me coming from a System Administration background and having gone
					through multiple legacy system swaps and the chaos of go-lives.  The book introduced agile concepts, use of Kanban boards,
					and other strategies to streamline processes in an IT departments by creating processes that identify types of work and complete them efficiently.

					I did enjoy the Phoenix Project and when I saw Beyond the Phoenix Project, I couldn't resist but to listen to it. 
					The format is a conversation that takes you through the journey of DevOps, and along the way, you pick up concepts and 
					names of industry leaders who pioneered some of the ground work in DevOps.  As you listen to this conversation, you will 
					find yourself adding more books to read about some of the concepts.  Great book if you want more knowledge into DevOps.
